## About Me

I'm a recent graduate of UC Berkeley's Master in Data Science (MIDS) program. Currently I am working
in MIDS as a Course Coordinator in the Statistics class and a TA in the Machine Learning at Scale class.
Before joining MIDS I worked as a structural engineer designing bridges and other heavy infrastructure.

## Projects

In my time at MIDS I have had the opportunity to work on several very cool projects. Two of them are 
on the way to being published in a journal. Most links here are public. Some are private to encourage
academic honesty among my students. If you want access give me a ring and I can add you as a collaborator.

_Projects are presented in reverse chronological order_
