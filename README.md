## About Me

I'm a Data Scientist and a graduate of UC Berkeley's Master in Data Science (MIDS) program. Currently I am working
as a consulting Data Scientist for Austin Capital Data helping deliver insights for a variety of clients from 
fortune 500 corporations to startups to the federal government. I'm also working part time as a Course Coordinator 
in the MIDS Statistics class coordinating grading and lecturing on statistics concepts.
Before going into Data Science, I worked as a structural engineer designing bridges and other heavy infrastructure.

## Projects

In my time at MIDS I have had the opportunity to work on several very cool projects. Two of them are 
on the way to being published in a journal. Most links here are public. Some are private to encourage
academic honesty amongst my students. If you want access give me a ring and I can add you as a collaborator.
